Develop a website using WordPress with the features listed below:

• Site should contain at least 3 pages of content. This could be blog posts, product

information or something similar. “Lorem Ipsum” or similar placeholder content can
be used.
• Site should demonstrate that you understand the difference between pages and posts
in WordPress.
• Site should contain images. You do not have to have images on every page, but you

your website.
